I am a Python engineer and applied mathematician with special interests in research engineering, reinforcement learning and statistical modeling.
At Altius Institute for Biomedical Sciences in Seattle, I apply state-of-the-art deep learning methods to synthetic biology and generate rich visualizations of genomic data.
Previously, I spent a year developing an algorithmic trading research platform at Quantopian in Boston.
In my free time I enjoy teaching myself the fundamentals of various subfields under the artificial intelligence umbrella. Recently, I've been working through online courses and textbooks on reinforcement learning, bayesian statistics and applied probability.

Outside of computer science and mathematics I love soccer, basketball, hiking, skiing, fantasy football and guitar, and I (attempt to) solve the New York Times crossword every day!
